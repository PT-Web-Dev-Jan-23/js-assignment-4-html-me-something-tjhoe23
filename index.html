               <h2>The day has come. Geese are taking over the world.</h2>
               <p>Not really. But the scenarios can happen, and will. 
                  This is a list of animal i could take in a fight.
                  I will share some info on the animal, tell you my strategy, and rate them on a scale to ten on how easy I could beat them.

               <h2>The common field mouse</h2>
               <p>The first animal I could definitely take in a fight, is a field mouse. Omnivorous rodents, eating everything in their path, seeds, plants, or vegetables. Carrying a list of diseases while infesting homes. 
                  These little things are not to be trifled with, creating mass havoc is their duty.
                  But a one on one with a field mouse, easy. A light punt would definitely incapacitate any creature this fragile and this small.
                  10/10, This is the easiest fight of my life.
               </p>

               <h2>My sister's house cat</h2>
               <p>The second animal I could definitely take in a fight, is probably my sister's house cat. While not being my toughest opponent, it could pose a threat. 
                  Their evolution begins 25 million years ago, belonging to the same family as lions and tigers. Becoming some of the most highly-developed hunters.
                  While still tiny in size, these feline friends can swiftly turn foe in the blink of an eye. I really just have to watch out for them pouncing on me and scratching/biting me, but in all honesty the cat doesn't stand a chance.
                  10/10, One right hook can easily prove my foe weak.

               <a name="goose"></a>
               <h2>A goose</h2>
               <p>The third animal I could definitely beat in a fight is a goose. My first flying opponent. This one never really was a challenge to me, it's not the size of a horse or anything.
                  The only fear people have of geese, is being bitten. But with such a large and flat beak, how much damage could it really do? The force is completely spread out.
                  I have definitely never been scared of a goose, 10/10, if I'm facing one in the octagon, he's going down.

               <a name="mediumDog"></a>
               <h2>Medium sized dogs</h2>
               <p>The fourth animal I could take on in a fight, I would have to say are medium sized dogs. Any breed, medium sized dogs are usually wusses. The saying all bark no bite goes a long way here.
                  I've never been scared of a dog in my life. If you get into the beagle, husky, or retriever range, my biggest fear is being licked to death. 
                  I'd probably take a wrestling approach, get it in a double-leg takedown, move to a full nelson. It wouldn't even have a chance to tap out. 10/10, the fight would be over in the first 30 seconds.
               </p>

               <a name="eagle"></a>
               <h2>A bald eagle</h2>
               <p>The fifth animal I could probably beat in a fight is a Bald Eagle. This is where my list starts getting tricky, another flying opponent. 
                  Some key details to remember here, the average eagle weights between 6 and 14 pounds. Flying at an average speed of 30 mph, and diving up to speeds of around 100 mph.
                  These beasts have 8 massive talons and a pretty good sized beak for offense. It definitely would have a huge speed advantage, especially being able to fly, and as fast as it is.
                  First off you go for the wings, make them unable to fly. Wait for them to dive bomb, and boom, grab and roll, leaving the bird incapacitated. I think a good elbow thrown in there would do the job.
                  8/10, making sure to keep your vital organs protected is a big key to this battle. (Side note; bald eagles have been federally protected since 1940, and this whole page is completely hypothetical.)

               <h2>A chimpanzee, wild or from the zoo</h2>
               <p>The next animal I'd say i could take in a fight, is a chimpanzee. Wild or from a zoo.
                  These animals have huge fighting capabilities, with a massive physical strength advantage. On average being four times stronger than humans because of their dense muscle fiber.
                  But in all honesty, with slight training, I believe I could best any chimpanzee. If he wants a street fight, we can get down and dirty.
                  If he wants a ring fight, we can get out the gloves. Personally, I'd rate the fight a 6/10. They have been known to best humans in almost every aspect of physical capabilities. 
                  But I still have the brains, and can probably out smart these simple minded beings.

               <a name="kangaroo"></a>
               <h2>A kangaroo</h2>
               <p>The ninth animal I could go one on one with in the ring, is a kangaroo. The ultimate test for any man. One on one with a kangaroo. 
                  Known for their fighting and more specifically boxing capabilities. However, the fact of the matter is that everyone knows how a kangaroo fight.
                  It's studied, it's precognated. Standing on their tail and fighting with their feet. I would say it'd be a strong 5/10. 
                  Only for the fact of their sheer strength being their legs. I would start by taking out the tail and trying to restrain its legs. 
                  Going about this like a normal boxing match however, it would come down to who can get in the best hit, and how many hits you could take from this animal.

               <a name="wolf"></a>
               <h2>A wolf</h2>
               <p>Here is where my list gets really tough. Now that I'm to the point of large scale predators, a wolf is definitely one up there I would try to fight. Not because I think it would be easy, nay, the complete opposite.
                  This is my toughest fight yet, but wolves have one downfall. They're scared. Easily intimidated. A little wave of my arms and that thing is shakin' in its boots. 
                  I'd definitely have to go into this mentally strong, because there is no out-classing these beasts. They're faster, they're stronger, and way too ferocious. 
                  I'd definitely rate this fight a 2/10. You have to be trained, you have to be mentally and physically stronger. It's not a likely thing to happen. 
                  But once it's scared and scowering, speed is of the essence. Even if you manage to subdue this animal, they're not known to back down.

               <h2>A crocodile</h2>
               <p>Never seeing a crocodile in real life, this could get tricky. But people survive crocodiles all the time, right? 
                  Coming in at a massive 2200 lbs and can range anywhere between 10 to 23 feet long, this is no oridinary fight. 
                  You can't just box these things and think to win. You have to think strategy, you have to think dirty.
                  Coming in at a whopping 1/10, this is no normal feat.
                  I would start by getting on its back, I'd then go for the eye. That is the only reasonable way to win.
               </p>
